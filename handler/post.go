// 1. Handle incoming requests for uploading posts

`w http.ResponseWriter`:
	- An interface that allows you to send an HTTP response to the client
`r *http.Request`:
	- A pointer to an HTTP request object containing all the information about the incoming request
*/

/*
1. Why pass reference as a request?
  - to avoid deep copy the request, just shallow copy
    --> improve the performance

2. Why pass an object as a response?
  - `ResponseWrite` is an interface which could be declared, not be implemented
  - When used as a parameter in a function or method,
    it allows the function to work with any concrete implementation
    of the ResponseWriter interface, which makes the code more modular and flexible.
  - `net/httpâ€œ package takes care of creating a concrete implementation of the `ResponseWriter`
    --> you don't need to worry about the specific implementation details and
    can focus on handling the HTTP request and constructing the response
